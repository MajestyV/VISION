# VISION

*VISualize your ambitION*

## I. Introduction
This python package is designed for quick visualization of scientific data. It is based on the popular matplotlib library, but with a more user-friendly interface.

## II. Requirements

Recommended python version: 3.10 (which is used by myself)

Anyway, in theory it should work with any python version >= 2.7.

Required packages:
- *Data acquisition*: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) & [xlrd](https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- *Scientific calculus*: [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) & [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- *Visualization*: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) & [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## III. Installation
```shell
